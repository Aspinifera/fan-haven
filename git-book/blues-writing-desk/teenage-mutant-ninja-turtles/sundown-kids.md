<summary>Synopsis</summary>

With the Krang defeated and his bones mostly intact, Leon's still trying his best to have what he's dubbed a "Hot Turtle Summer" while he's still a teenager. New York creeps into June just as expected, and he finds himself juggling a humiliating new crush, a potential karaoke career, and an obsession with everything Y2K.&#x20;

But not even Meghan, the queen of hot summers herself, could have prepared him for the gauntlet of black swans that spits him out in front of not one, but several alternate versions of his family. To top it off, they're all stuck at a dilapidated Catskills farmhouse that April roped them into fixing up.&#x20;

As Leo reaches his emotional carrying capacity, they realize that the alternates weren't the only ones torn from their own dimensions. With Leo's mental health declining with each day, the primordial beasts of the Prison Dimension watch a plan even older than the Krang come to fruition.
