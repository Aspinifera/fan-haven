"Sixteen turtles, one house, and zero intervention is an admittedly risky concept. But what's a show without excitement? Risk is our specialty, and risk means danger. Danger is very marketable. So, let's make a deal and give the public what we all want: a good show."

For the third season of TENetwork's hottest interdimensional series, a new cast finds themselves in the House. Selected from four dimensions, these feisty brothers will participate in daily and weekly challenges decided completely by viewers like you. And thanks to our multitude of stealthily placed HouseCams, you can now watch them 24/7 from the TEN app. It's on-demand drama like never before, right in the palm of your hand.
