# The Front Desk

The door shuts with a _click_ behind you. Blinking rain from your eyes, you look up. The man at the front desk looks up from his phone, eyes wide and a grin plastered on his face.&#x20;

"Hello!" he says. "Are you looking for something? A certain book, maybe?"

Surrounding you both are rows and columns of books. Warm lights bathe everything in shades of orange and gold despite the lack of sunlight.&#x20;
